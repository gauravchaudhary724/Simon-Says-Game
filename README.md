# Simon Says Game ðŸŽ®

This is my version of the classic **Simon Says** game. I built it using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to practice my web development skills and make something fun to play.

## About the Game
The idea is simple: the game shows a sequence of colors with sounds, and you have to repeat it in the same order. Each round the sequence gets longer, so it gets more challenging as you go. If you click the wrong color, the game ends and you can see your score.  

I made it responsive so it works on both desktop and mobile, and I tried to add smooth color and sound effects to make it more fun.

## How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
2. Watch the sequence of colors and listen to the sounds.  
3. Click the buttons in the same order.  
4. Keep going as long as you can!
